# 'Complete single vapp' vcloud-launch configuration example
#
# Each of the vm: subsections (hardware_config, network_connections, etc) 
# are optional, if not specified the defaults as set in the vAppTemplate 
# will be used.
#
# Specifically in this example, the instantiated VM will have:
#
#  * its memory reconfigured to 4096MB
#  * its cpu count reconfigured to be 2.
#  * The Primary NIC will be moved to FrontendNetwork, and given a manual ip
#    of 192.0.2.10
#  * A Secondary NIC will be created on BackendNetwork and given an IP address
#    via DHCP (the result of not supplying an ip_address parameter)
#  * a bootstrap 'guest customization script' is provided, which will be
#    interpolated via ERB. 
#  * Two additional extra_disks are supplied, sized at 10GB and 20GB respectively.
#    These are in addition to the existing system disk in the templated VM.
#  * 'vars' are supplied, which will be available to ERB when interpolating
#  * This output will be run through 'script_post_processor' - generally only 
#    needed if the interpolated  bootstrap script is 'large' (2048 bytes-ish)
#  * metadata is supplied which will be applied to the VM and the parent vApp
#    entities in vCloud Director. This is not available inside the VM itself :(
#  * A storage_profile is provided. The VM will be moved to this named storage
#    profile (which must be available in its vDC), if it is different to its 
#    current SP.
